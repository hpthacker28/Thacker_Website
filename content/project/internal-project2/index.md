Amid chaos, confusion and misery, there are only two things you need when it comes to surviving a pandemic:

1. Alcohol is your best friend

When entering a global pandemic, the one thing you need to prioritize above toilet paper, masks, gloves and clearing supplies, is alcohol. Whiskey, Vodka, Tequila, it doesn’t matter - pick your poison. You will spend sleepless nights and miserable days wondering about the state of the world. The news will permeate your every waking moment and every sleeping moment. You will grow restless and weary with anxiety about your loved ones. The solution to all of this, is to follow in the footsteps of those who have come before you and drink your sorrows away. 


2. Don’t be afraid to nudge the Granny at Costco

Picture this: It’s you and an elderly woman. There is one tube of lysol disinfecting wipes left on the shelf, what do you do? If you answered: let the elderly woman take the wipes because she is older and more at risk, you answered incorrectly. While you may retain your moral high ground, you are now wipe-less and unsure of when the next restock will come. How will you disinfect your bag or Doritos? How will you wipe down the packages you drunk bought from Amazon? No. In this dog-eat-dog world, you have to put yourself first. Nudge that Granny out of the way, and go along your merry way.

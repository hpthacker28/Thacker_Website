Her silky hair flows behind her.
The radiating sun glints off her, 
And gives her that ethereal glow I know so well.
The smell of the salt and sand fills my nostrils.
I desperately attempt to keep my eyes on the winding road ahead.
Her laughter fills my head,
it consumes me.
It fills the car with light as the radio croons a peaceful tone.
She flashes me the smile I know,
the smile that says it all -
her bright, dazzling smile.
We dream of roads to come.
Behind the glare of the light off my dusty windshield,
the road stretches on for eternity.

Just past the horizon I see our first apartment.
With a mean old cat pawing at the window,
hanging plants dripping water off their wide healthy leaves,
the vinyl scratches of hotel california playing in the distance.
Her arms draped around me, 
the smell of her vanilla lotion makes my heart skip a beat.
I turn and see those dimples on her blushing cheeks,
and kiss her soft lips with all the words I never needed to say.
The days will stretch on forever,
and the sun will illuminate our home for eons. 

She flashes me the smile I know,
the smile that says it all -
her solemn, bittersweet smile.
We see the road to come.
Behind the glare of the setting sun off my dusty windshield,
the end of the road is in sight.
Darkness creeps over the edges of the shoreline,
and the winding road grows dark,
The smell of salt and sand leaves my nostrils.
All that is left is her silence,
and the smell of dust.
